We're excited to announce the release of Astreos version 1.1.0! This update focuses on improving the user experience and squashing a few pesky bugs.

## What's New ‚ú®

*   **Improved Date Picker:** Selecting dates for bills and expenses is now smoother and more intuitive.
*   **Faster Loading:** We've optimized how data is loaded, resulting in quicker startup times, especially for larger budgets.
*   **Subtle UI Polish:** Various small adjustments to button styles, spacing, and alignments for a cleaner look.

## Bug Fixes üêõ

*   Fixed an issue where the calculated remainder didn't always update immediately after adding an expense.
*   Corrected a rare visual glitch in the closed period summary view.
*   Resolved a problem where editing a recurring bill sometimes didn't save changes correctly.

Thanks for using Astreos! As always, your feedback is welcome.
