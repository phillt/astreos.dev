Welcome to the first official release of Astreos!

We built Astreos because we believe budgeting shouldn't require subscriptions, online accounts, or complicated spreadsheets. It's designed from the ground up to be simple, private, and effective, especially if you manage your money paycheck-to-paycheck.

Key features at launch:

*   **Pay Period Budgeting:** Organize your income, bills, and expenses around your pay schedule.
*   **Bill & Expense Tracking:** Quickly add and categorize your spending.
*   **Budget Rollover:** Carry leftover funds to the next pay period.
*   **Offline & Private:** Your financial data stays securely on your computer.

We hope Astreos helps you take control of your budget. Let us know what you think!
