# ðŸš€ Astreos v0.6.0 â€“ Public Beta Release

Welcome to the first public beta of **Astreos** â€“ a modern, privacy-first budgeting app designed to help you take control of your finances without the stress or bloat of traditional finance tools.

This release introduces our core budgeting workflow and a fresh desktop experience tailored for people who want to **budget with intention, not just track transactions**.

---

## âœ¨ What is Astreos?

Astreos is a **paycheck-based budgeting tool**. Rather than managing an overwhelming monthly budget or syncing with unpredictable bank feeds, Astreos lets you **plan each pay period** from the moment your paycheck drops until the day before the next one.

Think of it as a **financial command center** for each paycheck â€“ organizing bills, setting aside spending money, and tracking upcoming expenses, all without needing to connect to your bank.

---

## ðŸ§­ How It Works

1. **Set Up Your Income**  
   Start by entering your primary source of income and how often you get paid (e.g., biweekly, monthly). This creates a recurring schedule of **pay periods**.

2. **Add Bills and Expenses**  
   Assign bills to your budget based on their due dates, and enter any one-off or recurring expenses. Everything stays organized around **when** the money needs to go out â€“ not just when it's charged.

3. **Budget Each Paycheck**  
   For every pay period, you'll see:
   - Your **expected income**
   - All **upcoming bills** and expenses due during the period
   - A place to track and categorize any extra spending

4. **Close Out Each Pay Period**  
   At the end of each period, you'll review what was paid and what wasn't, then decide whether to **roll over** unpaid bills or mark them as skipped. This helps you stay honest and flexible without losing track.

## ðŸ”’ Why It's Different

- **Offline-first**: Your data is saved locally, not in the cloud.
- **No logins or accounts**: You own your data. Period.
- **Works without syncing**: Stop worrying about broken bank connections. You're in control.
- **Paycheck-driven**: Budgeting is built around when money comes in â€“ not some arbitrary month.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for First-Time Users

- Use descriptive names when adding income and bills â€“ it'll make reviewing each pay period much easier.
- Add at least **one full pay period** to see the flow in action.
- Use the **closeout feature** at the end of each period to keep your budgets clean and up to date.
- Don't overthink it â€“ Astreos is designed to be simple, flexible, and forgiving.
