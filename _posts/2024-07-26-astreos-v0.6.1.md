We've rolled out some helpful updates in version 0.6.1 to make Astreos easier to use and more flexible if you ever want to start fresh.

## ðŸ§¹ Start Over Anytime
You can now **"Forget" your current budget** from the settings menu. If you want to clear everything and start fresh, there's a new button that lets you do exactly thatâ€”with a safety prompt to make sure it's what you want.

## ðŸ”­ Easier Navigation
We've cleaned up and simplified the settings area:
  - All settings now live under `/settings` so everything's easier to find.
  - If you head to a page that doesn't exist, you'll now be brought back to the welcome screen.

## ðŸ©¼ Small Fixes & Cleanups
  - Removed an old "Budget Settings" link that didn't do much.
  - Cleaned up some of the screens to make things simpler and more focused.
  - Updated icons to support the new reset button.
  - Behind the scenes, the app has been reorganized to make future updates smoother.
