Many budgeting apps today promise to make your life easier by syncing with your bank. At first, this sounds great—your bills and spending show up automatically. But in reality, syncing isn't always reliable or safe.

### Real People, Real Problems

One Reddit user shared this:

> "A lot of these integrations seem one sided where the service is just scraping the financial institute's web site... This is inherently brittle as just a slight change in formatting on the web site can break the side trying to read it."

Another website explained the risk of sharing your bank login:

> "Sharing your bank username and password with budgeting apps can violate your bank's terms of service and pose security risks."  
> — [Skwad Blog](https://skwad.app/blog/is-it-safe-to-connect-your-bank-account-to-budgeting-apps?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

These kinds of problems can leave users feeling frustrated and out of control. When your budgeting app doesn't work, you miss payments, lose track of your goals, and feel stuck.

### Why Manual Budgeting Works Better

Manual budgeting means entering your bills and spending by hand. It may sound like more work, but it actually helps you:

- **Pay closer attention to your money**
- **Stay accountable to your goals**
- **Avoid surprises**

A Reddit user explained it best:

> "Having to manually track every dollar I spend keeps me from spending unnecessarily. When it auto pulls and categorizes I don't feel accountable."

### Astreos: A Better Way to Budget

Astreos is different. It doesn't sync with your bank, and that's on purpose. We believe budgeting should give you more control—not take it away.

With Astreos:

- You enter your bills and income manually
- You plan each pay period based on what you actually earn
- You track what matters to you—on your terms

It's not just another app that does everything for you. It's a tool that helps you build real habits and take charge of your money.

**Budget smarter. Stay in control. Use Astreos.**
